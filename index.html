                    <p>Eldoria was founded in 532 BCE by King Theron after his victory in the Battle of Seven Rivers. The city quickly grew into a center of learning and commerce, attracting scholars and merchants from distant lands.</p>
                    <p>During its golden age (350-150 BCE), Eldoria was ruled by the Council of Sages, a group of twelve scholars who governed through consensus and were elected based on their contributions to knowledge.</p>
